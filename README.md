# colored-tag-list

Displays a list of colorful tags at the top of review cards. This color is always consistent.

To install, download the repo as a zip file, then extract into the anki addons folder (found in appdata)

This is adapted from someone else's tag-list extension (I couldn't find the original creator); I simply added the feature of consistent colors through a hash function.
